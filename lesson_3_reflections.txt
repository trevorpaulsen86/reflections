When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want a remote repo is for example I have others working on the project and there needs to be a place for everybody
to collaborate. Especially for really big projects it would be really inconvenient to host it all on one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A manual pull might might pull some changes before a new version is finalized. A major change may take more than one commit.
