What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it begins tracking changes to files in that
folder. You need to do this if you want to start using version control
on a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to see what changes will be committed before doing
the commit. It can allow the user to double-check their changes before
committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can see all the files that will be changed when a commit is made, and you
can use git diff to see if all the changes made go along with each other.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful if you are taking the development in an experimental new
directions and there is no guarantee that all the changes will be kept. It can
also help if there is a slightly different version of the project you need to
create, but you don't want that to be the main version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me visualize the branch structure by making the structure visual.
It's easier to know how something works if I can see it, and that's what the
structure does.
