What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it begins tracking changes to files in that
folder. You need to do this if you want to start using version control
on a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to see what changes will be committed before doing
the commit. It can allow the user to double-check their changes before
committing.
